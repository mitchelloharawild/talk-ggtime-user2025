#### Abstract

While several commonly used plots exist for visualizing time series, little work has been done to formalize them into a unified grammar of temporal graphics. Re-expressing traditional time series graphics such as time plots and seasonal plots with grammatical elements supports deeper customization options. Composable grammatical elements provide the flexibility needed to easily visualize multiple seasonality, cycles, and other complex temporal patterns. These modular elements can be composed together to create familiar time series graphics, and also recombined to create new informative plots.

The ggtime package extends the ggplot2 ecosystem with new grammar elements and plot helpers for visualising time series data. These additions leverage calendar structures to visually align time points across different granularities and timezones, warp time to standardize irregular durations, and wrap time into compact calendar layouts. In this talk, I will introduce ggtime and demonstrate how its grammar of temporal graphics enables a flexible visualization of time series patterns.
